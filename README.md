# Elastic Microlearning EMIL

## Project Description
This project is a dynamic and continuously updated **initiative that aims to provide concise and targeted learning materials** for professionals in the field, primarily Solution Architects. The content covers a wide range of topics relevant to elastic solution architects. It includes bite-sized modules on latest releases, elastic infrastructure design, deployment strategies, performance optimization, scalability, security considerations, and elastic solutions. The materials incorporate real-world scenarios, case studies, and practical examples to ensure the learners gain practical insights and are well-prepared to address the challenges they may encounter in their roles.

The continuous updates of the project ensure that the learning materials stay current with the rapidly evolving field of elastic solutions. New techniques, tools, and industry trends are regularly incorporated into the content, ensuring that the learners receive the most up-to-date information. The project also encourages learners to provide feedback and suggest additional topics to further enhance the learning experience.

Overall, the microlearning for elastic solution architects project offers a flexible, engaging, and practical learning experience. It equips professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills to design, deploy, and optimize elastic solutions effectively, empowering them to excel in their roles as solution architects in today's dynamic and ever-changing technological landscape.


## General Approach
**Microlearning** delivers educational content in small, easily digestible units, typically ranging from a few minutes to around 10-15 minutes. The goal is to provide learners with targeted and concise information that can be quickly absorbed and applied.  It leverages the idea that learners have limited attention spans and may prefer to learn in smaller, more manageable increments. By breaking down complex topics into bite-sized modules, microlearning aims to improve retention and engagement. It allows learners to access and consume content on-demand, at their own pace and convenience. The advantages of microlearning include: time efficiency, focus on specific learning objectives and presenting information in a concise manner,  enhances retention and recall of important concepts, keeps learners engaged and motivated.

**Snippets** refer to a small and concise piece or extract of something, typically text, code, or media content. It is a shortened version or excerpt that highlights a specific part of a larger whole. Snippets are often used to provide a glimpse or representation of the complete content, allowing for a quick overview or reference. It could be a brief video clip, a concise paragraph of text, a mini-quiz, or any other condensed form of information that is designed to deliver a specific learning objective or concept. Snippets are beneficial in microlearning because they offer learners bite-sized and focused content that can be consumed quickly and easily. They aim to deliver key information or engage learners in a compact and efficient manner.

## Template
Templates are necessary for several reasons:

* **Consistency**: Templates ensure consistency in the structure and format of content. By using predefined templates, you can maintain a consistent style and layout across various modules, lessons, or documents. This consistency enhances the overall user experience and makes it easier for learners to navigate and understand the content.

* **Efficiency**: Templates save time and effort by providing a framework that can be reused for multiple projects or modules. Instead of starting from scratch every time, you can use a template as a starting point and customize it according to your specific needs. This allows you to streamline the content creation process and focus more on the actual content rather than formatting and organization.

* **Clarity and Organization**: Templates help to organize information in a logical and structured manner. They provide a framework for presenting content in a clear and cohesive way, ensuring that all relevant aspects are covered. Templates often include sections or headings that prompt you to include specific information, making it easier to ensure that no essential details are missed.

## Snippet Form
Two forms in consideration: md file or an issue

While GitHub issues can be used for tracking and discussing specific topics, they may not be the most suitable choice for managing microlearning snippets. Issues are better suited for tracking tasks, bugs, or discussions, rather than organizing and presenting short, self-contained content pieces like microlearning snippets.

In summary, using separate Markdown documents for each microlearning snippet in GitHub provides better organization, version control, collaboration, documentation, flexibility, and searchability compared to using GitHub issues.
